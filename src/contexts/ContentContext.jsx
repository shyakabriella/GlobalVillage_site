It is a story of family, culture, hospitality, and kindness, carried from the banks of the River Nile to the beautiful land of a thousand hills (Rwanda).\n\nInspired by Dana, a remarkable woman born more than 150 years ago in a Nubian village on the western bank of the River Nile in northern Sudan, our hotel represents the true meaning of home. Dana was known for her kindness, unity, and love for family. Her home was a place where everyone felt welcomed, cared for, and treated as part of the family.\n\nThat same spirit lives on at DANA KIGALI HOTEL.\n\nLocated in Kigali, Rwanda, DANA KIGALI brings together the rich heritage of African, Nubian, Arab, and Islamic hospitality with the beauty and warmth of Rwanda. Just as Dana\'s home was a place of togetherness, comfort, and belonging, our hotel is designed to make every guest feel relaxed, valued, and truly at home.\n\nWhether you are visiting Kigali for business, leisure, family travel, or a short stay, DANA KIGALI HOTEL offers a welcoming atmosphere, comfortable accommodation, and personal service inspired by deeply rooted values of hospitality and care.\n\nFor us, hospitality is beyond business. It is about welcoming you with kindness, treating you like family, and creating a stay filled with comfort, peace, and memorable moments.\n\nAt DANA KIGALI HOTEL, you are not only our guest — you are part of our family.\n\nPlease feel at home.'
